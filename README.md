# UW Winter 2022
# Lab Partner: Samuel Cormier
EE 241 is an introduction to programming for signal and information processing course. We used Jupyter Notebook for the labs and coded in Python 3. The course starts off with data types, variables, syntax, if/else, and loops. From there we worked with sound files, images, structured datasets, and graphs. 

# Learning Objectives (as posted on the course canvas page)
- Implement simple programs addressing multiple signal and information processing applications;
- Read and write data in different file formats associated with time signals, images, and other information sources;
- Understand how to work with a variety of data types associated with different signals/applications;
- Use standard packages applied in signal and information processing, such as SciPy, NumPy, pandas, etc.; and
- Use functions to plot, play or visually render different signals or information sources.
